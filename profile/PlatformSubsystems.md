# Welcome to the Synthetic Data Platform Git Hub site ðŸ‘‹
This is the updated work that was started within Project-Herophilus's Data Synthesis 
project (https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/DataSynthesis). We have moved this work into its own organization 
to help us give it a long-term viable future as a free-standing asset. There are many more repositories now and we can focus 
on how to continue the great work done over the last three years by amazing individuals and companies like Red Hat, IBM, 
Microsoft and others.
