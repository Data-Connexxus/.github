# The Synthetic Data Platform: How It Works
In order to leverage the platform the following core steps should be completed:
- The DDL for the supported data technology that is needed is implemented
- The data technologies data structure is seeded with data for the Synthetic Data Platform

# Core Platform Activities
Overall the platform design is focused on a series of automic methods that provide very 
specific capabilities that can be invoked in a variety of ways.

## Supporting Activities
Supporting activities for the platform deal with customizing referencial data activities for 
referencing or tagging data within the platform for the implementations needs.

## Data Generation 
The following is a specific list based on the specific data attributes that are provided by the 
platform.

### Data Attributes
The following are data attributes that have data generation capabilities, including the ability to 
upsert (insert/update) records.

| Attribute              | Purpose | 
|------------------------|---------|
| Account Numbers        |         |
| Addresses              |         | 
| Bank Accounts          | |
| Credit Cards           ||
| Drivers License Number |         |
| Date of Birth          |         |
| Generic Reg Exp        ||
| Phone Numbers - US     ||
| Serial Numbers         ||
| SSN                    ||
| User Identities        ||

There are also a few specific data attributes that are established but have not been tested as there 
has been no use cases for their usage.

| Attribute           | Purpose | 
|---------------------|---------|
| Phone Numbers - Intl |         |
| Addresses - Intl    ||

### Data Structures
The following data structures are implemented with the core platform.


| Structure            | Purpose | 
|----------------------|---------|
| Phone Numbers - Intl |         |
