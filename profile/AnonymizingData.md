# Anonymizing Data
Anonymizing data is defined by TechTarget as: "Data anonymization describes various techniques 
to remove or block data containing personally identifiable information (PII). Data anonymization 
promotes data privacy while maintaining the integrity and usefulness of the overall data set.
This approach supports analysis and research without revealing the identity of any subjects involved." 

* It is a growing area of provided offerings. Most cloud providers and cloud centric data companies have offerings in this space now. 
In addition to this there are numerous offerings available, from libraries to technology platforms that range from open source to freemium 
  (Some are free, and some are paid within technologies). Our goal and intent is to be a "powered by" technology platform that can be molded 
  like clay, for benefit groups from testing to data integration to application development.
* Our efforts are designed around a very flexible computational data model that can. Our initial focus for the first several years was on 
  enabling massive amounts of extensible data to be used quickly for many needs. Why should organizations risk <a href="https://www.breachlevelindex.com/"

  potential leakage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_health_information" target="_blank">PHI (in healthcare)</a>
  or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data" target="_blank">PII (In any other industry)</a>?
